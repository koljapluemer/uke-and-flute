## Notes

- it seems *very* difficult to find reasonably simply MIDI melodies, without chords (and none of them are adapted to uke)

## Libraries

### magenta music

- seems nice and potent, maybe overkill
- has cool visualizers here: <https://magenta.github.io/magenta-js/music/demos/visualizer.html>
